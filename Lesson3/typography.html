            <strong>Web typography</strong> refers to the appearance of all the text on your website. It includes basic CSS text 
            properties like what font to use and whether it should be italic or not, but typography is much more 
            than that. It's about the space between and around letters, words, and lines. It is the size of the 
            different text sequences in relation to each other and the story behind each font family
