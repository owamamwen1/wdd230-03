            Weather forecasting is the application of science and technology to predict the conditions 
            of the atmosphere for a given place and time. People have tried to predict the weather 
            informally for millennia and formally since the 19th century. Weather forecasts are made 
            by collecting quantitative data on the current state of the atmosphere, land, and ocean.
            . Real-life scenarios big Ideas start with a small project.
